    "This is the assessment for the Statistics in Practice - Python Module. It counts as 30% of your overall mark for the module.\n",
    "\n",
    "The assessment is to be undertaken individually. Your work must be submitted in the form of a single jupyter notebook. \n",
    "The assessments will be released during the workshops, and are due a week later. Please check the submission box for the exact submission deadline. \n",
    "Before your results and feedback are returned you might be asked to have a short (approximately 5 minutes) individual \"interview\" to discuss some aspects of your work. The outcome of this interview might impact on your overall individual score.\n",
    "\n",
    "The three assessments are equally weighted.\n",
    "\n",
    "To score full marks in the questions you must show all of your code and calculations, make good use of plots for visualising and summarising your data, discuss any limitations associated with your approach, and comment your code.\n",
    "The questions are \"exploratory\" in nature, so you are expected to reflect on what you are being asked to do and research the methods being developed. For example, you might choose to investigate what the effect of the quadrat size has on the power of the method for determining non randomness, or you might want to say something about how the likelihood of a obtaining a particular result might be quantified, and so on ....\n",

    "You can use the internet to search for examples of python code that may be useful, but do make reference to your sources. \n",
